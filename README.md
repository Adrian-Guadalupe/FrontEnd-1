## MVP
- Onboarding for three user types: Admin, Student, and Volunteer. Each user type will have their own view.
- Ability for an admin to create and edit a training “to do list” volunteers to complete. Saving a to do list will make it appear on the volunteers homepage.
- Homepage for volunteer to view their to do list from an admin.
- Homepage for students to see the profiles of all registered volunteers. They can search by their listed availability times, or their country.
